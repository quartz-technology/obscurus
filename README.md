## Disclaimer

This project is currently in its early development stages and is not production-ready.
It is provided "as-is" with limited functionality and definitely contain bugs or incomplete features.
Users must exercise caution when using it, as critical features or optimizations required for production environments are missing.

We encourage testing and experimentation in non-production local environments and welcome feedback to improve the project.
However, please refrain from deploying it to live networks until it has reached a stable release version.

Use at your own risk.

## Acknowledgements

We wanted to thank the following entities / persons for their precious help. This project would not exist without their contributions and solutions:

- [Safe](https://safe.global/). This project relies on the Safe Wallet, so it is obvious that they deserve a praise.
- [Zodiac](https://zodiac.wiki/). Extra-logic on Safe Wallets can only be achieved via Zodiac Modules.
- [Colin Nielsen](https://github.com/colinnielsen). We used [safe-tools](https://github.com/colinnielsen/safe-tools) to test Obscurus, and its design is partially inspired by [dark-safe](https://github.com/colinnielsen/dark-safe). Go ahead and take a look at Colin's projects, they're amazing.
- [PSE](https://pse.dev/). Obscurus would have been much more difficult to develop if it was not without Semaphore, the framework built by the PSE team.

## Introduction

In this section, we introduce the goal of Obscurus and the some of the concepts required to better understand how it works.

### Concepts

As a remainder, in a Safe Wallet, the owners of the multisig must approve a transaction prior to its execution by providing a signature over the transaction data.
If more than a given number of approval have been submitted (this number also being known as the threshold), the transaction can be executed.

Here is an illustration to showcase this mechanism:
<p align="center">
    <img src=".github/assets/README_ILLUSTRATION_1.png" width="800" alt="">
</p>

Obscurus is a plugin that can be attached to a Safe Wallet, with the ability to bypass this whole transaction approval flow and execute them based on a custom one.
This custom approval flow also makes use of a group of owners, that we call identities, who can submit anonymous approvals.
With Obscurus, signatures over the transaction data are anonymous but with the guarantee that they have been made by the group members only and that a single identity cannot submit an approval more than once.

Note that the Safe Wallet can still use its owners to approve and execute transactions, but those will not be anonymised.

Again, here is an illustration to showcase this mechanism:
<p align="center">
    <img src=".github/assets/README_ILLUSTRATION_2.png" width="800" alt="">
</p>

Here, nobody knows who out of Alice, Bob and Charlie submitted the signed approvals, except the Relay.
To improve anonymity, the identities could use new EOAs everytime they submit the approval to the Relay, as an identity is not linked to an EOA.

### Goal

The goal of Obscurus is to provide an anonymity layer to the Safe Wallet owners, while preserving the security guarantees of the multisig.

## Architecture

        Obscurus->>Obscurus: Validate proofs onchain
        Obscurus->>Safe Wallet: Execute transaction
    end
```

This sequence diagram simplifies a lot the interactions, but highlights the most important things:

- Obscurus is attached to the Safe Wallet.
- The identities controlling Obscurus generate proofs.
- The identities send their proofs to the Relay.
- The relay triggers the execution using the proofs.
- Obscurus verifies the proofs onchain and triggers the execution on the Safe Wallet.

One very important thing to mention which is not represented in the diagram is that from an external perspective, we don't know which of the identities send their proofs to the Relay.
It could be Alice and Bob, Bob and Charlie or Alice and Charlie, we just don't know.
Ensuring privacy when sending the proof from the identity to the Relay, or rotating EOAs when submitting the proof onchain is mandatory.

## Getting Started

This section is here to help you deploy and use Obscurus.
Please note that for the moment, the only documented way to deploy the project is on a local network, using Anvil.

### Prerequisites

Before you can deploy and use Obscurus, you must install a few tools:
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

Once installed, you can go ahead and follow the steps to deploy and use Obscurus using one of the available methods.

### Using Anvil Fork

Anvil let's you fork a network to deploy and interact with the Obscurus smart contracts.
You will deploy a Safe Wallet owned by a single address, deploy and attach Obscurus to it, owned by 3 identities (Alice, Bob and Charlie) and execute anonymously approved transactions in the Safe Wallet via the Obscurus Module.

Here are the identities public commitments (think of it as the public Ethereum address) and their respective private keys (used to generate the anonymous approvals).

| Name    | Public Identity Commitment                                                    | Private Key                                  |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Alice   | 16154315983106457604964519632507479861508345150261468393750536759701116467867 | zBdAt1wUe6DAK1wEXuJqeSyBiTX+UPA4M95TI3F9mIM= |

#### 1. Fork a network

To fork a network, use the following command and replace `<YOUR_RPC_URL>` with a real RPC endpoint.
Here, we will fork Holesky.
```shell
anvil -f <YOUR_RPC_URL> --auto-impersonate
```

#### 2. Deploy a Safe Wallet

Using the official Safe CLI tool, you can deploy a Safe using one of the Anvil default account as the owner:
```shell
docker run -it safeglobal/safe-cli safe-creator http://host.docker.internal:8545 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80
```

Here, `0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80` is the private key of one of the default account pre-funded in Anvil.

You should get an output similar to this one:
```shell

```

Copy and save the Safe Wallet address. In the example above, it is `0xF673A57299160A6E32A61e315c3199dCE0981cE3`.

#### 3. Deploy Obscurus

It is now time to deploy the Obscurus Module and attach it to the Safe Wallet you just deployed.
In your terminal, set the following environment variables:
```shell
export RPC_URL=http://localhost:8545
export ODS_SAFE_ADDRESS=0xF673A57299160A6E32A61e315c3199dCE0981cE3
export ODS_SAFE_OWNER_PK=77814517325470205911140941194401928579557062014761831930645393041380819009408
export ODS_THRESHOLD=2
export ODS_IDENTITY_COMMITMENT_0=16154315983106457604964519632507479861508345150261468393750536759701116467867
export ODS_IDENTITY_COMMITMENT_1=12241487482047535455927935140249225031445150086629846794755977920490270273737
export ODS_IDENTITY_COMMITMENT_2=15899159344494353576723282793888645985869881307160044049094584250085609856278
export ODS_NUM_IDENTITIES=3
```

Here, the threshold required to execute a transaction is 2, so you will need to provide 2 out of 3 anonymous approvals minimum so that the transaction can be executed.

Now run the following command to deploy the module and attach it to the Safe Wallet:
```shell
forge script ./script/Deploy.fork.holesky.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 --broadcast -vvvvv
```

If something went wrong at this step, try removing the `broadcast` and `cache` folders.
Otherwise, you should get a `broadcast/Deploy.fork.holesky.s.sol/17000/run-latest.json` file which contains the Obscurus deployment address.

Copy it and set a new environment variable in your terminal:
```shell
export ODS_OBSCURUS_ADDRESS=0x1c2fb12ecca5edb9ac8da583caa865e7c893a7ef
```

You can confirm that the Obscurus module has been enabled (attached) to the Safe by running the following command, which should print `true`:
```shell
cast call $ODS_SAFE_ADDRESS "isModuleEnabled(address)(bool)" $ODS_OBSCURUS_ADDRESS
```

#### 4. Approve a transaction

Before executing a transaction, it must be approved.
In the context of Obscurus, this means that at least K identities (with K being the threshold we defined earlier) must generate proofs.

You can think of those proofs as some kind of commitments over which transaction is approved.
They also prevent double-approval by a unique identity and guarantee membership, so the proof will be invalid if one identity submits two proofs for the same transaction approval or if an identity external to the group submits a proof.

To generate the proofs, run the following commands. Here, the transaction is very simple: it has no calldata, and transfers 0 ETH.
In a real world scenario, the group members generates a proof on their own and they all could send it to a trusted Relay for example.
```shell
# Identity 0 is Alice.
npx tsx test/ts-utils/obscurus-cli.ts prove --prover "zBdAt1wUe6DAK1wEXuJqeSyBiTX+UPA4M95TI3F9mIM=" --identities $ODS_IDENTITY_COMMITMENT_0 $ODS_IDENTITY_COMMITMENT_1 $ODS_IDENTITY_COMMITMENT_2 --obscurus-address $ODS_OBSCURUS_ADDRESS --rpc-url $RPC_URL --to "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266" --value 0 --data 0x --operation 0 > /tmp/proof-alice.json

# Identity 1 is Bob.
npx tsx test/ts-utils/obscurus-cli.ts prove --prover "QigfrBOzbDNxo9Y7aJQoY52OSwsdOuEtnFvKFaPaG4g=" --identities $ODS_IDENTITY_COMMITMENT_0 $ODS_IDENTITY_COMMITMENT_1 $ODS_IDENTITY_COMMITMENT_2 --obscurus-address $ODS_OBSCURUS_ADDRESS --rpc-url $RPC_URL --to "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266" --value 0 --data 0x --operation 0 > /tmp/proof-bob.json
```

#### 5. Execute a transaction

Now that the proofs used to approve the transaction have been generated by the identities, you can execute it using the following command.
This will verify the proofs onchain and require that at least the threshold is respected.

Here the proofs files are named for simplicity but they obviously should not leak the identity of their creators.
Also, note that the address sending the transaction (`--signer`) is someone else. In fact, tt could be anyone sending the proofs on the behalf of the identity!
```shell
npx tsx test/ts-utils/obscurus-cli.ts exec --proofs /tmp/proof-alice.json /tmp/proof-bob.json --signer "0x59c6995e998f97a5a0044966f0945389dc9e86dae88c7a8412f4603b6b78690d" --obscurus-address $ODS_OBSCURUS_ADDRESS --rpc-url $RPC_URL --to "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266" --value 0 --data 0x --operation 0
```

Which should print something similar to this:
```shell
{"hash":"0xa2232db6e0a3821e21a6dbb607742cbeb434d44a31401bc87073a3c59ffaa7ae","result":[true,"0x"]}
```

Well done! The Safe Wallet has executed a transaction which has been proved by the Obscurus Module and does not leak the identity of the members that have approved it in the first place!
In a real world scenario, nothing can link the proofs to their creator and therefore nobody will be able to know who has approved (or restrained from approving) a transaction.

#### 6. Invalid transactions

You can also generate only one proof and try to execute the transaction, it will not work at the threshold is not met:
```shell
# Identity 0 is Alice.
npx tsx test/ts-utils/obscurus-cli.ts prove --prover "zBdAt1wUe6DAK1wEXuJqeSyBiTX+UPA4M95TI3F9mIM=" --identities $ODS_IDENTITY_COMMITMENT_0 $ODS_IDENTITY_COMMITMENT_1 $ODS_IDENTITY_COMMITMENT_2 --obscurus-address $ODS_OBSCURUS_ADDRESS --rpc-url $RPC_URL --to "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266" --value 0 --data 0x --operation 0 > /tmp/proof-alice.json

npx tsx test/ts-utils/obscurus-cli.ts exec --proofs /tmp/proof-alice.json --signer "0x59c6995e998f97a5a0044966f0945389dc9e86dae88c7a8412f4603b6b78690d" --obscurus-address $ODS_OBSCURUS_ADDRESS --rpc-url $RPC_URL --to "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266" --value 0 --data 0x --operation 0
```

You should get the following error:
```shell
/Users/Developer/obscurus/test/ts-utils/node_modules/viem/utils/errors/getContractError.ts:78
  return new ContractFunctionExecutionError(cause as BaseError, {
         ^
ContractFunctionExecutionError: The contract function "obscureExecAndReturnData" reverted.

Error: NotEnoughProofs()
```

Or, you can also try to temper with one of the generated proof.
Lets try to approve a transaction with 2 entities and corrupt one of them:

## Before running the command below, edit the /tmp/proof-alice.json.
## Try replacing one of the nullifier field for example.
##

npx tsx test/ts-utils/obscurus-cli.ts exec --proofs /tmp/proof-alice.json /tmp/proof-bob.json --signer "0x59c6995e998f97a5a0044966f0945389dc9e86dae88c7a8412f4603b6b78690d" --obscurus-address $ODS_OBSCURUS_ADDRESS --rpc-url $RPC_URL --to "0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266" --value 0 --data 0x --operation 0
```

This will result in the following error:
```shell
/Users/Developer/obscurus/test/ts-utils/node_modules/viem/utils/errors/getContractError.ts:78
  return new ContractFunctionExecutionError(cause as BaseError, {
         ^

ContractFunctionExecutionError: The contract function "obscureExecAndReturnData" reverted with the following signature:
0x4aa6bc40
```

Here, `cast` can help us decode the error:
```shell
cast decode-error 0x4aa6bc40
# Semaphore__InvalidProof()
```
