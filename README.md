## Disclaimer

This project is currently in its early development stages and is not production-ready.
It is provided "as-is" with limited functionality and definitely contain bugs or incomplete features.
Users must exercise caution when using it, as critical features or optimizations required for production environments are missing.

We encourage testing and experimentation in non-production local environments and welcome feedback to improve the project.
However, please refrain from deploying it to live networks until it has reached a stable release version.

Use at your own risk.

## Acknowledgements

We wanted to thank the following entities / persons for their precious help. This project would not exist without their contributions and solutions:

- [Safe](https://safe.global/). This project relies on the Safe Wallet, so it is obvious that they deserve a praise.
- [Zodiac](https://zodiac.wiki/). Extra-logic on Safe Wallets can only be achieved via Zodiac Modules.
- [Colin Nielsen](https://github.com/colinnielsen). We used [safe-tools](https://github.com/colinnielsen/safe-tools) to test Obscurus, and its design is partially inspired by [dark-safe](https://github.com/colinnielsen/dark-safe). Go ahead and take a look at Colin's projects, they're amazing.
- [PSE](https://pse.dev/). Obscurus would have been much more difficult to develop if it was not without Semaphore, the framework built by the PSE team.
